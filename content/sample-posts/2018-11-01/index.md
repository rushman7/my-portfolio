Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automatron devised by John Horton Conway. This is my rendition of the classic Conway's Game of Life but built strictly with React. 

##### Stack:
- React.js:
    - Based on **reusable components** to build an entire app
    - High performance with the **virtual DOM**
    - Powerful **dev tools** for faster debugging
