Adventure MUD is a small Multi User Dungeon game where you can traverse through a pre-determined range of maps and you can interact with the players
in each map. Docker is used for the messaging API. Each player in the room is notified when a message is sent, a player joins the room, and when a player leaves the room.

##### Stack:
- React.js:
    - Based on **reusable components** to build an entire app
    - High performance with the **virtual DOM**
    - Powerful **dev tools** for faster debugging
  
- Django:
    - Works well with React.js due to use of components
    - Don't have to work with DB queries.
    - DRY
