Poke-Pal is a small app created with React. Data is parsed from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)

[Github](https://github.com/rushman7/Poke-API)

##### Stack:
- React.js:
    - Based on **reusable components** to build an entire app
    - High performance with the **virtual DOM**
    - Powerful **dev tools** for faster debugging

- Plans: 
    - Move data onto a database and remove localstorage to remove any and all loading.
    - Allow any and all methods of filtering
    - Better CSS
    - Animations
    - More data when clicking endpoints.
